# Video Script: "What Are Tokens in AI?"

## üé¨ Video Structure (5-7 minutes total)

### Introduction (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Show the AI KnowledgeMate application running
**Script**: 
> "Welcome! Today we're diving into one of the most important concepts in AI: tokens. Think of tokens as the building blocks that AI models use to understand and process text. Let me show you how this works in real-time with our token logging system."

### What Are Tokens? (1-2 minutes)
**Visual**: Run the test-tokens.js script and show different text examples
**Script**:
> "Tokens are the fundamental units that AI models break text into. Let me demonstrate this with some examples:
> 
> When I send 'Hello' to the AI, it becomes 1 token.
> 'Hello world' becomes 2 tokens.
> 'Hello world, how are you today?' becomes 6 tokens.
> 
> Notice how punctuation like commas count as separate tokens. Even spaces can be tokens!
> 
> Here's something interesting: the word 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' gets broken down into multiple tokens because it's so long."

### Why Tokens Matter (1 minute)
**Visual**: Show the cost calculations and token counts
**Script**:
> "So why should you care about tokens? Three main reasons:
> 
> 1. **Cost**: Every token costs money. OpenAI charges about $0.00000015 per input token and $0.0000006 per output token. That might seem small, but it adds up quickly!
> 
> 2. **Speed**: More tokens mean longer processing time. The AI has to work harder to process more tokens.
> 
> 3. **Limits**: AI models have maximum token limits. GPT-4 can handle about 128,000 tokens total - that's your input plus the AI's response."

### Real Demonstration (2-3 minutes)
**Visual**: Run the main index.js application
**Script**:
> "Let me show you our token logging system in action. I'll make several different types of requests to demonstrate how token usage varies:
> 
> First, let's ask a simple question about tokens...
> [Show the OpenAI request and response with token logging]
> 
> Notice how we can see exactly how many tokens were used for the input, output, and total. We even get a cost estimate!
> 
> Now let's try a different AI provider - Cohere...
> [Show the Cohere request and response]
> 
> Different providers may tokenize text slightly differently, which affects costs.
> 
> Finally, let's look at embeddings...
> [Show embeddings token usage]
> 
> Even when we're just converting text to numbers for AI processing, we're still using tokens."

### Practical Tips (1 minute)
**Visual**: Show optimization examples
**Script**:
> "Here are some practical tips for working with tokens:
> 
> 1. **Be concise**: Shorter prompts use fewer tokens and cost less
> 2. **Avoid repetition**: Don't repeat the same information multiple times
> 3. **Use the right model**: Some models are more efficient than others
> 4. **Monitor usage**: Always track your token consumption like we're doing here
> 
> Remember: tokens are the currency of AI interactions. Understanding them helps you optimize both costs and performance."

### Conclusion (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Show the final summary screen
**Script**:
> "Tokens are the foundation of how AI processes text. They determine cost, speed, and limits. By understanding and tracking tokens like we've done today, you can make smarter decisions about your AI usage.
> 
> Thanks for watching! Don't forget to check out our GitHub repository for the complete token logging system."

## üéØ Key Visual Elements to Include

1. **Terminal/Console**: Show the actual token logging output
2. **Side-by-side comparisons**: Different text lengths and their token counts
3. **Cost calculations**: Real-time cost estimates
4. **Provider differences**: OpenAI vs Cohere tokenization
5. **Error handling**: What happens when things go wrong

## üìä Sample Talking Points

- "Notice how 'Hello world' is 2 tokens, but 'Hello world!' would be 3 tokens because the exclamation mark counts separately"
- "This longer sentence uses 15 tokens - that's why it costs more and takes longer to process"
- "The AI's response used 45 tokens, so we're paying for both what we sent and what we received"
- "Different AI providers may tokenize the same text differently, which is why costs can vary"

## üé¨ Recording Tips

1. **Screen recording**: Focus on the terminal/console output
2. **Voice clarity**: Speak slowly and clearly when explaining technical concepts
3. **Visual highlights**: Use cursor movements to highlight important numbers
4. **Pacing**: Pause briefly after showing token counts to let viewers absorb the information
5. **Error handling**: If an API call fails, explain what happened and why

## üìù Post-Production Notes

- Add captions for technical terms
- Include timestamps for key sections
- Add visual overlays for important numbers
- Consider adding a progress bar for longer demonstrations
