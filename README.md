Zero-Shot Prompting :
        Summarize this research paper in 5 key points.

One-Shot Prompting :
        Example: 
            Input: "Explain Quantum Computing in simple terms."
            Output: "Quantum computing uses qubits that can represent 0 and 1 simultaneously, allowing faster problem-solving."

            Now, Input: "Explain Generative AI in simple terms."


Multi-Shot Prompting  :
        Example 1:  
            Input: "Summarize: 'AI can help doctors detect diseases early.'"  
            Output: "AI enables early disease detection."

        Example 2:  
            Input: "Summarize: 'Renewable energy reduces pollution and saves costs.'"  
            Output: "Renewables cut pollution and save money."

        Now, Input: "Summarize: 'Generative AI creates new content like images, text, and music.'"

Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT) :
        You are AI KnowledgeMate, a research assistant. 
        Question: "What are the main contributions of the latest research on Generative AI?"  

        Steps to follow:  
        1. Break the question into smaller parts.  
        2. Reason step by step.  
        3. Summarize the reasoning.  
        4. Finally, give the answer in 2–3 sentences.
